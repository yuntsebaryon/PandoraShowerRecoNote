\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In summary, we describe the automated shower reconstruction based 
on the outputs of Pandora pattern recognition,
and the subsequent $\pizero$ mass reconstruction.
We study single electron, photon, and $\pizero$ Monte Carlo
simulation, and apply the algorithms to a set of six data events
which are identified as charged current $\pizero$ production
by the $\nu_{\mu}$ charged current inclusive filter,
\texttt{PiZeroROI} selection, and handscanning.
% The particle flow clustering and 
% shower reconstruction used in 
% this note are fully automated.
Five of these data events have two showers with nonzero energy
from a neutrino candidate, and the reconstructed mass is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pi0_mass_result}
m_{\pizero} = 106.76\pm 12.84~\mbox{MeV (stat.)}
\end{equation}
The statistics are too low to draw a conclusion.
