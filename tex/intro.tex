\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

An important step to obtain the primary physics goals at MicroBooNE,
as well as the Liquid Argon TPC community, is a fully
automated chain for reconstruction.
The study presented in this note aims to develop automated
shower reconstruction algorithms based on the outputs of Pandora 
pattern recognition.
In~\Cref{sec:reco,sec:mc}, we describe the algorithms and the
performance on the simulated events, respectively,
while \Cref{sec:data_pi0} shows a few events of charged current $\pizero$
production in data selected by handscanning
are tested in a preliminary stage.
We outline the current issues, ongoing studies, and short-term
plans in~\Cref{sec:ongoing} before summarizing in~\Cref{sec:summary}.\\
