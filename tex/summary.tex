\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

In this note, we dispict the shower reconstruction based on Pandora
outputs and the subsequent $\pizero$ mass reconstruction.
We study single electron, photon, and $\pizero$ Monte Carlo
simulation, and apply the algorithms to a set of six data events
which are identified as charged current $\pizero$ production
by the NuMuCC filter and handscanning.
The particle flow clustering and 
shower reconstruction used in 
this note are fully automated.
Five of these data events have two showers with nonzero energy
from a neutrino candidate, and the reconstructed mass is
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pi0_mass_result}
m_{\pizero} = xxx.x\pm xxx~\mbox{MeV (stat.)}
\end{equation}
