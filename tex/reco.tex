\section{Shower Reconstruction}

In this section we describe the underlying concepts for shower reconstruction.
The technical details are dispicted in DocDB ?.

\subsection{Brief Introduction to Pandora}

Pandora is a toolkit for pattern recognition, aiming to 
reconstruct particle flow in detectors with fine granularity, such as
detectors of high-energy lepton colliders, and LAr TPC.
MicroBooNE uses Pandora, which is integrated into the LArSoft toolkit
via the \texttt{larpandora} interface,
as one of the pattern recognition and clustering algorithms. \\
\\
In addition to clustering, Pandora provides further information, such
as particle flow hierarchy, track-shower separation, three-dimensional
spacepoints, and vertices of each particle.
In the following sections, the algorithms of shower reconstruction 
utilizing these features are described.
