\section{$\pi^{0}$ Mass Reconstruction in Data}
\label{sec:data_pi0}

% Samples
% We use two data samples in this study,
% \begin{itemize}
% \item 12 events, \texttt{PiZeroROI} + handscanning
% \item 6 events, NuMuCC filter + \texttt{PiZeroROI} + handscanning
% \end{itemize}
In this study, we investigate six events in data which pass
the NuMuCC filter, \texttt{PiZeroROI} selection and 
handscanning (ref.xx).\\
\\
All the shower-like PFParticles in the events in the data sample
are reconstructed as described in~\Cref{sec:reco}.
The subsequent step would be to find the two showers decaying from a 
$\pizero$ so that the $\pizero$ mass can be reconstructed according
to~\Cref{eq:pi0_mass}. \\

% Find the two showers: PFParticle hierarchy
Owing to the selection criteria of $\pizeroroi$, there is exactly one
neutrino-like PFParticle with two or three shower-like daughters in
each event.
Utilizing the hierarchy feature of Pandora outputs thereby becomes
the most straightforward strategy.
We loop over all the neutrino-like PFParticles (PDG code 12 or 14), 
identifying the one with at least two shower-like daughters.
In most of the events (five out of six), this kind of neutrino-like 
PFParticle has exactly two 
shower-like daughters, and the $\pizero$ mass is directly evaluated
from those two showers.
In the case that there are three shower-like daughters, we loop over
all the combinations of the showers and select the one with the largest
reconstructed $\pizero$ mass.
This approach gives us a reasonable result in our high-purity samples
as shown in~\Cref{fig:mpi0_data,table:mpi0_data}.
The values of nonzero $\pizero$ reconstructed mass are roughly
consistent with the peak value of the $\pizero$ distribution obtained
from single $\pizero$ MC events, \Cref{fig:mpi0_single_pi0}.\\

% Ongoing issues
The most relevant topic on the current $\pizero$ mass reconstruction
in high-purity $\pizero$ samples is the deficiency in the reconstructed
energy, which shifts the peak of the $\pizero$ mass distribution, as
demonstrated in~\Cref{fig:mpi0_single_pi0}.
The same feature is obviously seen in the studies with the single electron
and photon MC samples in~\Cref{sec:single_em}.
We discuss the ongoing studies and possible corrections in~\Cref{sec:ongoing}.
